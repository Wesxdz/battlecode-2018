OPTIMIZATION
Wrap() can initialize to length to avoid resize
Recieve previous iteration.
Persist Data
	- Dictionary and Struct
	- can_sense_unit() persist
Break up Calls

TACTICS
Group
Manager
Policies/ Behvaiours 

We should group things
Factores will produce things and then they will join a group
When a group has a purpose or enough member it will set out to perform an action
 - Explore, Attack, Build, Defend, etc.
the group will orient the memers correctly

Group will take in ID and construct entity from it
Hold entity in Vector
Initialize Vector to some size, 5, 10, 20, etc

// For example Vector<Group>
//	Loop
//	Group.Action()

// Also Rangers
// AttackVision = 50~
// (GetEnemyPosition - RangerPosition) Squared < AttackVision = Attack

// I need PathFinding
// Workers should focus on structurs and Karb
// I should persist data over frames - Check if Unit can be Seen?
// Have Entities know of data relevant to them, Pathfinding, Destination, Priority/ Group                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

Tactics
Have Maximum Workers so replication doesn't overcome normal units ~50
50 * 3 = 150 per turn or 200 if upgrade
50 * 5 = 250 build or 500, aka 1 factory

Designate Structures to load in a specific direction

Utility Methods
GetOtherTeam(Team)
IsRobot(UnitType)

- Finding enemy Starting spot
Worker 
- CanBuild(Direction)

MapPlanet
GameMap
Methods that need to be fixed
GameController::GetUnits(Selection)
Location::Garrision()

Lecture AI
Finds enemy starting spot.
Does an initial run through of units to count and keep track, then process
sense_nearby_units(unit.location.map_location(), 2) will get all surrounding units
// Need to check if unit is garrisioned, becasue we can not move then...

Errors
Segmentation Error, we are deleting a specific pointer multiple times
